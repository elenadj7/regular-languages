# The library designed for working with regular languages

In files, there are two main parts: a set of instructions and a related application that uses those instructions. The instructions include different types of processes like finite automata, regular expressions, and a lexer. The goal of this program is to mimic the behavior of regular expressions in a simplified way.

Here's how it works:

1. The program has a set of rules that are defined in classes. These rules help in recognizing patterns, making decisions, and performing specific actions.
2. Users can load a set of predefined rules from a file. These rules are used to check whether a given input meets certain conditions or not. The result could be either "accepted" or "rejected."
3. The program also allows users to define their own rules using regular expressions. These expressions can be loaded from a file and converted into a set of rules that the program can understand.
4. There's a special feature that generates Java code. This code can perform certain actions on the rules, based on what the user wants. It's like creating a customized program using the basic building blocks provided by the main program.
5. The regular expressions used in this program can include operations such as "and," "or," and "Kleene star." These operations help in combining and manipulating different rules to achieve more complex behavior.

In simple terms, this program helps users define sets of rules to check if certain patterns exist in input data. It also allows users to create custom rules and even generate code to perform specific actions based on these rules.
